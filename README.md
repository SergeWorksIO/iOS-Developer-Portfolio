   <h3>About Me:</h3>
   <p>
      I'm a software engineer based in Mission Viejo, CA, who is passionate about building mobile applications for iPhone devices.
I love the development process for building applications, from planning to prototyping to turning those prototypes into working products and getting them in the hands of people all over the world.
I focus a lot on software architecture; how to make maintainable, reusable, and efficient code.

   <h4><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/atmosphere-for-skylight/id1463087351/">Atmosphere for Skylight</a> (May 2019 - Oct 2019)</h4>
   <h5>Overview:</h5>
   <p>
      Atmosphere is a work order management application.  It operates under the CRUD (create, update, read, and delete) operations found in most data repositories and allow users to create, assign, and update the status of work orders. The content and operations available to each user are dependent on their role in their organization.
The beauty of Atmosphere is that it provides its users with different ways to create work orders such as the "traditional" fill out the form style, through voice command or through the use of QR codes.

   <h5>Contributions:</h5>
   <ul>
      <li>Report / fix bugs in different parts of the application (user interface, voice command, data persistence, etc.)</li>
      <li>Added search bars to filter long lists of content presented for user selection</li>
      <li>Utilized the Eureka framework to create dynamic work order forms (read and write) </li>
      <li>Developed a camera mechanism to allow users to add photos of their work order</li>
      <li>Developed an image preview mechanism that allowed the annotation of work order images</li>
      <li>Leveraged internal APIs to create a document management system to allow users to add, preview, edit, and delete multiple photos in new or existing work orders</li>
