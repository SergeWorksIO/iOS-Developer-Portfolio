   <h3>About Me:</h3>
   <p>
      I'm a software engineer based in Mission Viejo, CA, who is passionate about building mobile applications for iPhone devices.
I love the development process for building applications, from planning to prototyping to turning those prototypes into working products and getting them in the hands of people all over the world.
I focus a lot on software architecture; how to make maintainable, reusable, and efficient code.

   <h4><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/atmosphere-for-skylight/id1463087351/">Atmosphere for Skylight</a> (May 2019 - Oct 2019)</h4>
   <h5>Overview:</h5>
   <p>
      Atmosphere is a work order management application.  It operates under the CRUD (create, update, read, and delete) operations found in most data repositories and allow users to create, assign, and update the status of work orders. The content and operations available to each user are dependent on their role in their organization.
The beauty of Atmosphere is that it provides its users with different ways to create work orders such as the "traditional" fill out the form style, through voice command or through the use of QR codes.
   </p>
   <h5>Contributions:</h5>
   <ul>
      <li>Report / fix bugs in different parts of the application (user interface, voice command, data persistence, etc.)</li>
      <li>Added search bars to filter long lists of content presented for user selection</li>
      <li>Utilized the Eureka framework to create dynamic work order forms (read and write) </li>
      <li>Developed a camera mechanism to allow users to add photos of their work order</li>
      <li>Developed an image preview mechanism that allowed the annotation of work order images</li>
      <li>Leveraged internal APIs to create a document management system to allow users to add, preview, edit, and delete multiple photos in new or existing work orders</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h4>Book Search (May 2019)</h4>
   <h5>Overview:</h5>
   <p>
      Book search is an application that allows users to browse books in the Open Library's website catalog and add their favorite to a wish list.</br> 
      I created this project to get a better understanding of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable">Codable Protocol</a> used to parse JSON data received when making API calls. It was also an opportunity for me to challenge my skills by programmatically creating a complex user interface using collection views and animations.

   <h4>Rage Cage (Aug 2018 - Dec 2018)</h4>
   <h5>Overview:</h5>
   <p>
      Rage Cage is a hyper-casual game inspired by the famous game Flappy Bird in which users manipulate the bounce of a ping pong ball and attempt to land it in the opening of a stack of cups to score points.</br> 
This was my first publication to the Apple App Store and my first attempt to advertise and monetize my work.

   <h4>Cat Tracks (Aug 2018 - Dec 2018)</h4>
   <h5>Overview:</h5>
   <p>
      Cat Tracks is an application created for the University of California, Merced's bus system. Its goal is to provide students a fast and interactive way to read the school's bus schedule. 
This application allows users to enter both the current location and destination in the form of bus stops or landmarks. It then determines and presents the bus lines connecting these two locations along with a list of departure and arrival times.
   </p>
   <h5>Contributions:</h5>
   <ul>
      <li>Refined prototypes for presentations and created final designs</li>
      <li>Developed a page that allows users to access each bus line's Twitter feed that bus drivers use to notify bus riders of traffic updates</li>
      <li>Developed the application's main navigation menu (animated)</li>
      <li>Conducted users search comparing the performance and user experience of the school's bus website and mobile application</li>
   </ul>

   <h5>Overview:</h5>
   <p>
      Go Too is an application that creates virtual communities for students in the same class and to provide them with several forms of communication that they can use to collaborate and help one another.
This project introduced me to iOS development and stirred my focus as a software engineer towards mobile application development.
